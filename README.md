# WebCeph2k Dataset and implementation code
## WebCeph2k: A New Benchmark for Cephalometric Landmarks Localization in Orthodontics

PyTorch implementation for cephalometric landmark detection on ISBI2015 and WebCeph2k datasets.

## Abstract
Cephalometric landmark detection is a critical and arduous task in the realm of medical image processing. The accurate identification of cephalometric landmarks is imperative for guiding orthodontic treatment and visual treatment objects (VTO) in orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery. Unfortunately, the lack of publicly available datasets for this purpose presents a significant challenge in obtaining accurate and practical results in cephalometrics. To combat this issue, we present the WebCeph2k dataset, a novel resource for cephalometric landmark localization that is more extensive and includes more landmark types than the only existing public dataset, ISBI2015. Furthermore, we evaluate the WebCeph2k dataset using four models to establish a baseline and develop a cascade convolutional neural network to enhance landmark localization precision. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when tested on both the ISBI2015 and WebCeph2k datasets, and our research findings exhibit significant potential in the field of cephalometrics.
