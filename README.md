# WebCeph2k Dataset and implementation code
## WebCeph2k: A New Benchmark for Cephalometric Landmarks Localization in Orthodontic

PyTorch implementation for cephalometric landmark detection on ISBI2015 and WebCeph2k datasets.

## Abstract
Accurately locating cephalometric landmarks is essential for guiding orthodontic treatment and visual treatment objects (VTO) in orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery. However, there is a lack of publicly available datasets for this purpose, making it challenging to obtain accurate and practical results in cephalometrics.

## Prerequisites
